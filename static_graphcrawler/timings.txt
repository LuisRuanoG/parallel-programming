Parallel Graph Traversal - Performance Summary
Platform: Centaurus
Compiler: g++ -std=c++17 -O2
Max Threads: 8

Test Configuration:
Start Node: "Tom Hanks"
Depth: 2

Sequential Version:
Time to crawl: 3.30099 seconds

Parallel Version:
Time to crawl: 0.561352 seconds

Speedup:
3.30099 / 0.561352 ≈ 5.88x

Observations:
- Parallel execution significantly reduces runtime.
- Speedup is limited by network latency and server response time.
- BFS is executed level-by-level.
- JSON validation prevents crashes under high concurrency.
